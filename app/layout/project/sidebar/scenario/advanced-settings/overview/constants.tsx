        <p>The BLM should be either ‘0’ or a positive number.</p>

        <p>
          It is permissible for the BLM to include decimal points (e.g. 0.1). Setting the BLM to ‘0’
          will remove boundary length from consideration altogether.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is no universally good value for the BLM, as it works in relation to the costs and
          geometry of the study region/planning units.
        </p>

        <p>
          With a small BLM, Marxan will concentrate on minimizing overall reserve cost and will only
          aim for compactness when little extra cost will be incurred.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alternatively, a large BLM will place a high emphasis on minimizing the boundary length,
          even if it means a more costly solution.

        <p>
          The number of repeat runs you want Marxan to perform; effectively, the number of solutions
          to the reserve problem you want Marxan to generate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each new run is independent of the previous one, but they will all use the same parameter
          and variable values. The frequency with which planning units are selected in multiple
          runs, gives an indication of the importance of that planning unit for efficiently meeting
          your reserve targets.
        </p>
        <p>
          When running a new scenario for the first time it is always advisable, to begin with a
          very small number of runs (e.g. 10) so you can check the program is performing as desired
          (i.e. the solutions are meeting the required targets) without having to wait a long time.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to get an idea of selection frequency, however, you will generally need to do
          many runs.
        </p>
        <p>
          100 runs are the standard best practice, as it is an intuitive value from which to
          calculate selection frequency. Adding more runs will sample more of the solution space but
          will of course increase the processing time.

        <p>
          There are situations where Marxan can get extremely close to the target (e.g. 99% of the
          desired level) without actually meeting the target.

          This value should always be high, i.e. greater than or equal to ‘0.95’. If you are setting

          When Marxan starts a run, it must generate an initial reserve system. This variable
          defines the proportion of planning units to be included in the initial reserve system at
          the start of each run.

          The variable must be a number between 0 and 1. If zero is chosen then no planning units
          will be included in the initial reserve, a value of 1 means all planning units will be
          included, and a value of 0.5 means 50% of planning units will be randomly included.

          This is an essential variable that defines the method Marxan will use to locate good
          reserve solutions. The real strength of Marxan lies in its use of Simulated Annealing to
          find solutions to the reserve selection problem. However, Marxan is also capable of using
          simpler, but more rapid, methods to locate potential solutions, such as heuristic rules
          and iterative improvement.
