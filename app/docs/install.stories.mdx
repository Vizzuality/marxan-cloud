## 2. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
First, install all the dependencies and packages

`yarn install`



## 3. DEVELOPMENT
Once you installed all the dependencies and packages you will be able to run these commands available in `package.json` by using `yarn dev`, `yarn build` or `yarn start`

```json
// package.json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
}
```

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

- `dev` - Runs next dev which starts Next.js in development mode
- `build` - Runs next build which builds the application for production usage
- `start` - Runs next start which starts a Next.js production server
