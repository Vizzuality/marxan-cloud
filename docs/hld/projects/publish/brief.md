# Publishing Marxan Cloud projects

This document describes the current high-level overview of the Marxan Cloud
platform user features related to publishing of projects.

## Aim

Users should be able to publish Marxan Cloud projects to the community for a
range of purposes:

- A user may share a project with people outside of their organization.
- Anyone can browse all published projects.

In general, publicly shared projects are valuable resources for the conservation
community as they allow practitioners to highlight conservation planning
processes, preserve a public record of planning projects, and share knowledge
and examples.

# User actions

According to the
[design](https://www.figma.com/file/p2R8McgbBALAQcdhcklTjq/Marxan-Visual_V03?node-id=7686%3A12851)
project publishing is available under a dedicated button.

This moves us to the
[configuration](https://www.figma.com/file/p2R8McgbBALAQcdhcklTjq/Marxan-Visual_V03?node-id=7721%3A10180).

After entering all relevant information, the project can be published.

The user can change that configuration later using the same page under "Update
community project" button.
