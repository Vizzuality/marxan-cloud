# Publishing Marxan Cloud projects
This document describes the current high-level overview of the Marxan Cloud platform user features related to publishing of projects. It is a working document, meant to gather feedback on the requirements before moving on to high level design and detailed implementation plan.

## Aim
Users should be able to publish Marxan Cloud projects to the community for a range of purposes:
- A user may share a project with people outside of their organization.
- Anyone can browse all published projects.

# User actions
According to the [design](https://www.figma.com/file/hq0BZNB9fzyFSbEUgQIHdK/Marxan-Visual_V02?node-id=4671%3A8116) project publishing is available under a dedicated button.

This moves us to the [configuration](https://www.figma.com/file/hq0BZNB9fzyFSbEUgQIHdK/Marxan-Visual_V02?node-id=4684%3A7130).

After choosing all new information the project can be published.

The user can change that configuration later using the same page under "Update community project" button.
