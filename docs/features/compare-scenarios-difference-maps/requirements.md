# Difference Maps - Brief

This document represents the initial needs for comparing 2 scenarios under the same project in the map.

These needs were described initially [in this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r9Excv4juGThjPSdPZYx9yWke_LBh-LqGDFw6UTKa08/edit#heading=h.5bvu51b3m1x3),
and this document is the selection of the methodology agreement reached.

## User requirements

A user should be able to visually compare the selection frequency maps of 2 selected scenarios, as a way to analyze how much both scenarios differ based on their initial hypothesis.
