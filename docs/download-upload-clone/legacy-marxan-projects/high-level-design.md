# Uploading legacy Marxan projects - High-level design

Importing legacy projects requires several steps, outlined below.

## Workflow overview

From an API consumer point of view, importing a legacy project is performed
through three main steps and related endpoints.

### Preparation of project import process

`POST /api/v1/projects/import/legacy`

This step will prepare an empty project shell, as well as an empty scenario
shell, both of which will be populated later in the import process, unless
errors are raised while validating user-uploaded data.

The `projectId` of the project being created will be returned, so that the next
steps can reference the project.

### Data upload

`POST /api/v1/projects/import/legacy/:projectId/data-file`

API clients will need to use this endpoint to upload each of the files that
users provide.

Each upload will include the actual file alongside a small JSON metadata snippet
through which the API is informed about which kind of file this is, alongside
any other metadata needed to import it.

A unique `dataFileId` is returned for each file uploaded successfully.

As API clients send requests to this endpoint, the API keeps the uploaded files
in a temporary storage area, from which they will be later read and processed.

If a specific kind of file (for example, a planning grid shapefile) is uploaded
more than once, any previously uploaded copy is discarded and replaced with the
latest file uploaded. This would be sufficient if a user accidentally uploads
the wrong file.

In case an uploaded file needs to be fully removed from the set of uploaded
files (for example, if a user accidentally uploads a `puvspr.dat` file _as if it
was_ an `output.zip` file), a `DELETE` endpoint is provided, which can be used
with the `dataFileId` returned on upload:

`DELETE /api/v1/projects/import/legacy/:projectId/data-file/:dataFileId`

### Data validation and import

`POST /api/v1/projects/import/legacy/:projectId`

This endpoint will validate if all the required files have been uploaded,
return an error if not, or initiate the actual processing of the data to import.

Warnings or errors encountered during the validation phase of each piece
importer will be available via a dedicated endpoint: `GET
/api/v1/projects/import/legacy/:projectId/validation-results`.

Status information for the import process will be available, like any other
project- or scenario-related status, via `GET
/api/v1/projects/:projectId/status`.

As an example, API clients may decide to request validation results if the
project import process terminates with a failure, as reported by polling the
status endpoint, in order to display a list of errors to the user so that they
can amend their data before retrying the upload.

## Workflow details

### Preparation of project import process

- Users request to initiate a legacy project import, and provide basic project
  data:

  - project name
  - project description (optional)

- A shell of project should be created (this allows to have an id and to fire
  events as needed, and also to set things up for eventual cleanup).

- Project source (see section _Changes needed to existing platform features_
  below) should be set to `legacy_import`.

- A legacy project import start event (API event) should be emitted. This will
  signal that the project is not usable yet and it should not be included in
  lists of projects, displayed or edited in any way until the import process has
  completed successfully.

- The initial project owner should be set to the user performing the upload.

- A single new scenario shell should be created within the project shell, with
  the same name as the project name supplied by the user on upload.

### Data upload

Users will need to upload required files, and they will have the option to
upload optional files:

  - planning grid shapefile (as zip file, identical to any other shapefile in
    the platform)
  - `input.dat`
  - `pu.dat`
  - `spec.dat`
  - `puvspr.dat`
  - optionally, output files, as a single zip file with the whole contents of a
    Marxan `output` folder; not all these files will be needed/used, but they
    can be allowed in the import and discarded if not used
  - if users upload output files, they should be given the option to specify via
    a boolean flag whether the Marxan solver should be allowed to run (if not,
    historical imported solutions will be considered "final" as an archived
    representation of planning done outside of the Marxan Cloud platform)
  - if users upload output files, the `ranAtLeastOnce` flag of the scenario
    should be set to `true`

- Uploaded content should be stored in a temporary import folder linked to the
  `projectId` of the project being imported, within the storage folder allocated
  to project cloning (`/opt/marxan-project-cloning`).

### Data validation and import

Project components will be validated and imported through piece importers (and
associated validators). As for importing and cloning of native MarxanCloud
projects, these piece importers may run in batches, with batches being scheduled
according to data dependencies.

A failure (validation error or other kind of expected or unexpected failure)
within a piece importer will cause processing of the whole import process to
halt with failure _once all the pieces of the current batch have finished
processing, either with success or failure_. A failure event should then be
emitted, and API clients can use the validation results endpoint (see initial
section) to retrieve a list of errors that led to the import failure.

All validations for input files are expected to be done according to settings,
column types and allowed values documented in the _[Marxan Manual, 2021
edition](https://marxansolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Marxan-User-Manual_2021.pdf)_.

Validation is carried out asynchronously, using events linked to the id of the
project shell to report on status.

All validation errors and warnings should be collected and reported back to API
consumers as a single document gathering all the errors and warnings, through a
dedicated API endpoint.

#### Validation of Planning grid files

- Should be validated like any other shapefile (required components, size,
  etc.).

- Each distinct geometry should have a `puid` attribute in the attribute table,
  and this needs to be an integer number, zero or positive.

#### Validation of `input.dat` files

- All values in the _General Parameter_, _Annealing Parameters_, _Cost
  Threshold_ and _Program Control_ setting groups (see Manual section _5.3.1 The
  Input Parameter File (input.dat)_) should be validated to be of the correct
  type.

- All the values supplied should be validated through `MarxanParameters`.

- Defaults for missing keys should be set via `MarxanParametersDefaults`.

#### Validation of `pu.dat` files

- All the `puid` values in the planning grid shapefile should have a
  corresponding row in this file (`id` column values must match the `puid`
  values in the shapefile's attribute table) and not be duplicated; rows with
  `id`s that don't match any geometry in the shapefile should be reported as
  validation warnings only.

- Validation according to section 5.3.3 of the Marxan Manual for `cost` and
  `status`; `xloc` and `yloc` should be ignored.

#### Validation of `spec.dat` files

- Validation according to section 5.3.2 of the Marxan Manual.

- Either `prop` or `target` are supported, in line with the Marxan Manual. If
  both are set for any of the rows, an error should be reported to API
  consumers.

- If `target` is supplied, it is then internally translated to `prop` as
  `prop(feature) = target / sum(puvspr amount for the feature across all
  planning units))`.

- The `name` property should be enforced as compulsory (it is not compulsory per
  se according to the Marxan manual, but it will be needed in order to set
  feature names further on during the import process).

#### Validation of `puvspr.dat` files

- Validation according to section 5.3.4 of the Marxan Manual.

- `amount` is assumed to be either:

  - the extent of the feature within the PU in the EPSG:3410 SRID units, **if**
    the user supplies `prop` for the matching feature in `spec.dat`
  - a count, **if** the user supplies `target` for the matching feature in
    `spec.dat`; there is no need to care about units of measurement here,
    although we assume that the measurement unit is consistent across all the
    PUs for each feature in `puvspr.dat` and that it matches the unit used for
    the `target` value in `spec.dat` for the matching feature

- the original `amount` is recorded in a distinct column
  (`(geodb)scenario_features_data.amount`) as this is
  later used when generating `puvspr.dat` files for the Marxan workspace
  when running Marxan (`PuvsprDatService.getPuvsprDatContent()`), rather
  than calculating `amount` as the intersection area between feature and
  planning unit, for each planning unit, as would be done for projects
  created within the Marxan Cloud platform.

### Validation of Output files

- Validation according to section 7 of the Marxan Manual.

- For a first iteration of the import functionality, these files may be assumed
  to be substantially valid; handling possible tampering of these files would be
  a complex task way beyond the scope of an initial implementation.

### When validation fails

If any errors are raised through the validation step linked to any of the
relevant piece importers, the import process should fail, the project should be
marked as incomplete, and the only action allowed on it should be the deletion
of the project itself.

All the temporary uploaded data should be deleted from the cloning storage
volume (honouring the feature flag that allows to keep temporary files on the
filesystem).

Users should be able to see the list of errors gathered through the
validation step, via the validation results endpoint for the project.

### Importing data

- Planning grid should be set from the grid shapefile. The numeric `puid` of
  each planning unit should be set from the `puid` attribute in the source
  shapefile, so that this can then be matched to the relevant rows in input
  files.

- Initial cost surface should be set from `pu.dat`.

- PU lock status should be set from `pu.dat`. If any unexpected values are found
  in the `status` column of `pu.dat`, this will trigger a db error and this
  should cause the piece importer to fail.

- Project features should be created, via a spatial join between `puvspr.dat`
  and the planning grid.

In practice, this should lead to a single geometry per feature (that is, one
`(geodb)features_data` row) which is the spatial union of all the planning units
listed for the given feature in `puvspr.dat` (but see note below about manually
setting the feature `amount` per planning unit in order to preserve the value
provided on input via `puvspr.dat`). The name of the feature
(`(apidb)features.feature_class_name`) should be set from the `name` field of
`spec.dat`; if this is not present (it is not compulsory according to the Marxan
Manual) a warning should be raised and a dummy feature name should be set (e.g.
`Unnamed Feature #1`, etc. in some kind of numeric sequence).

Complexity of these geometries may be a concern in terms of storage and
performance, and it will depend on some key factors:

- Whether a regular or irregular grid is used
- Area and count of planning units
- Dispersion of the feature over the grid
- Area of the original geometry that falls into the grid (this need to be taken
  into account due to problems on recalculations that can occur later using the
  regenerated feature area)

The following assumptions and caveats apply for the initial implementation
described above:

- The aggregation of regular grids should not generate a large complexity in
  terms of geometry unless the PU size is small enough or the feature is very
  dispersed.
- The aggregation of irregular grids could become very messy due to initial
  polygon complexity, due to size, or due to dispersion.

All the following import steps are for the initial and only scenario created on
import.

- Lock status of planning units for the scenario should be set from `pu.dat`.

- A feature specification should be created, including all the features imported
  (and listed in `spec.dat`), setting their `fpf` and `prop` values from the
  uploaded `spec.dat` file; the feature specification should be then processed
  in order to get all the required `(geodb)scenario_features_data` rows set as
  required.

- Once `(geodb)scenario_features_data` rows have been created by processing the
  specification, the `amount` value for each feature (from the uploaded
  `puvspr.dat`) should be persisted in a new column of this same table
  (`(geodb)scenario_features_data.amount`)).

- If provided, solutions should be inserted in the relevant tables, marking best
  solutions as appropriate, alongside all the relevant data.

If the validation step linked to any piece importer was successful but warnings
were raised, these should likewise be available to users via the validation
results endpoint.

## Changes needed to existing platform features

- New db and TS enum: `(apidb)project_sources: ['marxan_cloud',
  'legacy_import']`.
- New column: `(apidb)projects.sources project_sources not null default
  'marxan_cloud'`.
- New column: `(geodb)scenario_features_data.amount`.
- New column: `(apidb)scenarios.solutions_are_locked boolean not null default
  false`.
- The main query in
  `api/apps/api/src/modules/scenarios/input-files/puvspr.dat.service.ts` should
  use this new field, `if not null`, instead of the calculation via intersection
  (`ST_Area(ST_Transform(st_intersection(species.the_geom, pu.the_geom),3410))`)
  that is normally carried out.
- When processing a request to run Marxan, reject the request if
  `(apidb)scenarios.solutions_are_locked is true`.
- Exclude projects for which an import process has started but hasn't finished
  yet, or has failed, from lists of projects.
- Forbid any changes to be applied to projects that have not been fully
  imported; deleting them should nevertheless still be possible (in which case
  any ongoing import process should be halted).
