# Uploading legacy Marxan projects

Conservation planners may wish to upload to a MarxanCloud instance "legacy"
Marxan projects - that is, data files used to run Marxan CLI projects (`.dat`
files), alongside geospatial files used to generate these `.dat` files through
offline workflows, for example using desktop GIS or conservation planning
software.

Users may find it useful to import such projects into a MarxanCloud instance, in
order to, for example:

- continue working on an existing Marxan project taking advantage of the user
  workflows and data visualization features of the MarxanCloud platform
- collaborate on a legacy Marxan project which is still being developed, by
  moving it to the MarxanCloud platform and keeping the project private, while
  giving access to other MarxanCloud users as contributors
- share a legacy Marxan project broadly, through the MarxanCloud platform's
  _community_ area, thus contributing to a public archive/showcase of Marxan
  planning projects

## Legacy Marxan projects import in MarxanWeb

For reference, the Python-based [MarxanWeb
platform](https://docs.marxanweb.org/) supports importing legacy Marxan projects
(`.dat` files alongside a matching planning unit grid as shapefile), with the
following restrictions for the imported projects:

- Project features cannot be added or removed
- Showing the project features on the map is not supported
- Zooming to project features on the map is not supported
- Project features have only basic metadata, e.g. simple names and no
  descriptions

## Requirements

### Essential project data

As the MarxanCloud platform has a core component of data visualization and
mapping, legacy Marxan projects may only be imported if they match some minimum
requirements in terms of geospatial data available:

- _all the input `.dat` files_ **must be provided**

- as a minimum, a _planning unit grid shapefile_ **must be provided**

This will be used in the MarxanCloud platform as the geospatial "scaffolding"
on which other data is projected.

Each planning unit in the grid shapefile must have a `puid` property set to
match the value used in the `pu.dat` input file.

### Marxan results

Projects that have been extensively developed outside of the Marxan Cloud
platform up to the point of, for example, developing conservation planning
recommendations based on results of the Marxan workflow may wish to also upload
Marxan *output* files to make sure that the solutions shown in the MarxanCloud
platform match what was generated by the Marxan CLI software and used as
reference for planning interventions.

In these cases, users should have the ability to upload the contents of the
Marxan `output` folder, with the assurance that running Marxan on the imported
project will be disabled in order to prevent historical/archived results from
ever being overwritten.

### Geospatial data

_@todo Legacy projects - examples from Okavango demo_

_@todo Decision tree to guide through choices about what a user may want to
achieve depending on use case, then provide information on what parts of the
MarxanCloud flow could be enabled according to the user choices **and** which
data is available for them to upload._

Other spatial data would "unlock" key features of the MarxanCloud platform:

**Shapefiles of features**

Without these, only presence/absence of each feature in any given planning unit
could be visualized (this data is inferred from `puvspr.dat` and `spec.dat`).

**Shapefiles of protected areas**

**Shapefiles of locked-in or locked-out areas**

**Cost surface shapefiles**
