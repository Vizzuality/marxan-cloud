     * That's it, for integration testing of API-side, we are fine just to do checks against `queue.jobs`.
     * We don't need to check if redis/queue works or anything on infrastructure.
     *
     *
     * If we would like to have a full-blown e2e test including GeoService and whole infrastructure, we would need real queues anyway
     * (and redis or in-memory redis) and decide when to run them (as heavy and potentially flaky ones).
     * And to run them on staging/prod environments (staging maybe after deployment, prod in regular intervals, for example daily)
     *
     * There are a few other options, as mocking bull/redis to go straight to worker within GeoService but they won't provide any real value
     * (what would it test? just additional effort on mocking, while it anyway tests very ends of each service
     *
