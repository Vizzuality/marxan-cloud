 * Log of JWT tokens issued.

 * clients, so that tokens can be easily revoked. This is particularly useful
 * for rotation of long-lived JWT tokens as may be used as API keys for bots or
 * cross-authentication between microservices.
 *
 * Revoking JWT tokens can currently be done by deleting all of the logged
 * IssuedAuthnToken records for a user (useful for ensuring that a user is
 * logged out of all their open sessions, if needed), or specific ones (may be
 * useful for long-lived JWT tokens).
 *
 * @TODO The actual "revoke" functionality (API endpoint to delete
 * IssuedAuthnToken) needs to be implemented.
